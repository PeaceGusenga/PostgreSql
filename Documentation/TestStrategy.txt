Test Strategy:

1. OBJECTIVE
The objective of this test strategy is to ensure the reliability, functionality, 
and performance of the PostgreSQL database using JavaScript-based tests.

2. SCOPE
The testing scope includes:
> Database connectivity and authentication
> CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
> Data integrity and consistency
> Performance and scalability
> Error handling and exception scenarios

3. TEST ENVIROMENT
> Database: PostgreSQL
> Programming Language: JavaScript
> Testing Framework: Mocha
> Assertion Library: Chai
> Operating System: macOS
> Test Management: JIRA

4. TEST TYPES
> Unit Tests: Focus on individual database operations and functions.
> Integration Tests: Test interactions between different components, modules, or databases.
> Performance Tests: Assess the performance and scalability of the database under varying loads.

5. TEST DATA 
> Create sample test data that covers a wide range of scenarios, 
including valid and invalid data, boundary conditions, and edge cases.
> Ensure the test data represents the real-world scenarios your application may encounter.

6. TEST EXECUTION
> Write test scripts using JavaScript, Mocha, and Chai.
> Execute tests locally or using continuous integration tools.
> Generate test reports for analysis and tracking.

7. DEFECT MANAGMENT 
> Track defects found during testing using JIRA.
> Assign appropriate priorities and severities to each defect.
> Provide detailed steps to reproduce the defects and attach relevant logs or screenshots.
